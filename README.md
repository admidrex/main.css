# AlphaVitality Website

Welcome to the AlphaVitality website project! This site is designed to empower men with science-backed strategies for sexual health, intimacy, and overall well-being. It is inspired by Shopifyâ€™s clean and professional design, with an emphasis on dark green and deep black as the primary colors.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the homepage.
- `main.css`: The stylesheet for the website, including all the styles for layout and design.
- `img.jpg`: Placeholder for any image you'd like to add (could be a logo, hero image, etc.).

## Setup

1. Ensure you have a text editor (such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text).
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the website.
3. You can customize the images, content, and text to suit your platform's needs.

## Customization

- Feel free to adjust the colors in the `main.css` to better fit your brand identity.
- You can add new sections or pages to expand the website further.
